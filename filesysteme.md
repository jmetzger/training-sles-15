# Filesysteme 

## Btrfs:

```
Bigger files are possible
snapshots 
subvolumes
Raid
more methods to achieve Data Intergrity
Special Tools needed (btrfs Tools)
df does not reflect size properly 
Mounting Snapshots
Safer because of COW (copy on Write)
-> Disabled on SLES 15 
```

## XFS 

```
Good for bigger files (Performance)
Bad Performance on small files
So it is mainly used
```

# Ext4:

```
Verbesserung von ext2
Journalbasiert, abw√§rtskompatibel
Rocksolid 
Quicker but not so many Features for Data Integrity 
```
